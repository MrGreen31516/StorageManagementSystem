# StorageManagementSystem
1. I'm trying to make a self-storage facility management command line program.
2. By self-storage I mean like the kind you see in the storage wars TV show.
3. I think I need a database, but I don't have one yet.
4. Basically, the end user is the manager of the storage facility, they need to be able to do the following: 
a) See available units. 

b) See rented units. 

c) Create new units (for example, if they physically build new units on their facility).

d) Be able to rent units.

e) Be able to "move-out" a unit, meaning the renter doesn't need the unit anymore, so turn a rented unit into an available unit.

f) Units have properties such as unit number, size (e.g., 10x10), what floor they are on (e.g., 1st floor, 3rd floor, etc.), price... that's all the properties I can think of at the moment.
