1. Driver.java is the file with the main method.
2. ProgramName.java is the name of the program, I can get creative and do one of those stick lettering graphic looking things and swap them out, so that's why I made it in a separate file.
3. Unit.java is a class that has a Unit constructor and attributes of a Unit, it also has a method that returns a Unit data type.
4. SelectionforUser.java is a class that asks the user to press 1 to see list of available units, 2 for rented units, 3 to create a new unit, and 0 to exit the program.
5. AvailableUnits.java is a class that produces the view when the user presses 1 (they see the list of available units).
6. I didn't make anything for when the user presses 2 yet, so nothing happens.
